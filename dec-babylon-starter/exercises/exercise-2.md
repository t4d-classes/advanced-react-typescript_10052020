# Exercise 2

1. Using the spheres and spotlights from class declarative demo and the DOM form, add buttons to the DOM form to toggle each spotlight.

2. Use a range input for each spotlight to adjust intensity. The min value is 0 and the max value is 3, the increment should change in tenths.

3. Implement at least one spotlight using a fully declarative approach, and one spotlight using an imperative approach within the overall declarative React code.

4. Ensure it works!
