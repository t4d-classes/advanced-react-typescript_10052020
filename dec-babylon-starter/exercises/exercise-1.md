# Exercise 1

1. Display two buttons (using the DOM, not WebGL GUI elements). The label of the first button is "Arc Rotate Camera". The label of the second button is "Universal Camera". 

2. Using the features of React, enhance the program to select the camera based upon clicking the buttons.

3. Display the name of the active camera next to the buttons. This name should change when clicking the buttons and chanding the camera.

4. When the Arc Rotate Camera is being used, display a [range input](https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/att_input_type_range.asp) which allows the use to drag the slider to change the radius parameter of the camera.

5. Ensure it works!
